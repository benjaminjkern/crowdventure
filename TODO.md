1. Make front end look GOOOOD
2. Put database onto aws
3. Provide some sort of security measures for logging in in general
4. Make views be either per account or like per ip or something so they dont just keep increasing everytime you open the page
5. Add the ability to edit suggested Choices from the account screen
6. Implement the rest of the backend calls on the frontend like the ability to like and dislike
7. Make home page not just display everything in the system so far, have it show a welcome message or something
8. Come up with an easy way to find the node you want a certain suggestion to point to (Maybe a separate edit action page and/or a search for node function)
9. Add the ability to log in as people other than Evan
10. Add a back button or some sort of history feature
11. Check to make sure multiple accounts aren't logged in as the same user
12. Make choices show up in sorted order
13. Currently deleting nodes does not delete suggestions pointing to the node. This should probably be fixed on the front end to disable actions that no longer point anywhere, or like if a page is ever loaded with an action that doesn't point anywhere, it gets purged
14. The choice buttons still have underlines on the text
15. Make everything cleaner to work in the cool async way
