1. Make front end look GOOOOD
2. Put database onto aws
3. Provide some sort of security measures for logging in in general
4. Make views be either per account or like per ip or something so they dont just keep increasing everytime you open the page
5. Make home page not just display everything in the system so far, have it show a welcome message or something
6. Add the ability to log in as people other than Evan
7. Add a back button or some sort of history feature
8. Check to make sure multiple accounts aren't logged in as the same user
9. Make choices show up in sorted order
10. Currently deleting nodes does not delete suggestions pointing to the node. This should probably be fixed on the front end to disable actions that no longer point anywhere, or like if a page is ever loaded with an action that doesn't point anywhere, it gets purged
11. The choice buttons still have underlines on the text
12. Make everything cleaner to work in the cool async way
