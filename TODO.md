1. Make front end look GOOOOD
2. Put database onto aws
3. Provide some sort of security measures for logging in in general
4. Make views be either per account or like per ip or something so they dont just keep increasing everytime you open the page
5. Make home page not just display everything in the system so far, have it show a welcome message or something
6. Add a back button or some sort of history feature
7. Make choices show up in sorted order
8. Currently deleting nodes does not delete suggestions pointing to the node. This should probably be fixed on the front end to disable actions that no longer point anywhere, or like if a page is ever loaded with an action that doesn't point anywhere, it gets purged
9. Make everything cleaner to work in the cool async way
10. Can suggest an empty choice
