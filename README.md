# Crowdventure

> By Ben Kern

Everyone likes Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games, but they often lead to some issues, such as:

- They often end up being very linear or have very little variety in story.
- It takes a lot of time and effort to make something that is in any way interesting.
- What do you do if you don't like any of the options given to you and just want to go on your own path?

**WELL HAVE I GOT THE SOLUTION FOR YOU**

Crowdventure is a web-based and dynamically crowd-sourced Create-Your-Own-Adventure game. With Crowdventure, you will be able to navigate the vast sea of possibilities that have been suggested by and democratically voted upon by the entire internet, as well as suggest and vote upon your own!

## What's new

- We are finally in public alpha mode! (Version 0.0.1) Please spread word about Crowdventure!
- The website is up! <https://benjaminjkern.github.io/crowdventure>
- Database working!
- Backend working!

## Potential Features that I think might be cool to add eventually

- Ad- or donation- based revenue to be able to have the website support itself
- Power to the users to create intricate designs on their node pages
- Save information variables that can be read by nodes, giving node creators far more power to make interesting games
- Randomize function that takes you down a random path, just for fun

I made this project originally for school, but I liked the idea a lot so I stuck with it.
