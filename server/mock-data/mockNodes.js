She correctly identified the six shirts, but also chose one from the control group. Eight months later, that person was diagnosed with ligma. Their name? Ninja.",

Just yesterday I had to leave home to bury my starving son, Ivan. He got the easy way out, the rest weren’t so lucky. Oh god... I can hear the screams of a man outside our bunker. I can’t help him. None of us can. We can only listen and hope he stepped on a landmine and won’t have to suffer no more. The paint on the walls is peeling off.. Our Herzegovinian flag, now filled with moths.. Food rations are short and the radiation seeping from under the faulty door is increasing by day. Branimir and Karima have not returned from the hospital, I fear they never will. Is there even a hospital there anymore? Did it blow up along with the old university in that bombing? What day is it? I’ve lost track of time. Does time even have a meaning in this war riddled wasteland? Oh god, help me, I’m cold.... But anyways I’m going off track. Very nice, I wish I could give you gold, but take this instead! 🏅",
